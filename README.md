# Management for Tech Professionals

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document and summarize all the management courses I studied.  
As a software engineer, understanding business and management principles helps me:
- Work more effectively in teams.
- Communicate better with stakeholders.
- Lead projects successfully.
- Align technical work with business goals.

This repo includes summaries, notes, and resources from the following management-related courses:
- Project Management
- Agile Leadership
- Business Strategy
- Marketing Basics
- Financial Fundamentals
- Time Management & Productivity

## 📚 Why I Learn Management as a Developer

Programming solves technical problems,  
but management solves people and process problems.  
Combining both gives me the ability to build **real-world impactful solutions**.

## 💡 Notes

Most content here is written in my own words as I understand the material.  
I may include PDF summaries, mind maps, or screenshots where needed.

## 📂 Structure

Each folder = 1 course  
Each course contains:
- `summary.md`: course summary
- `resources/`: optional files (PDFs, images, etc.)
